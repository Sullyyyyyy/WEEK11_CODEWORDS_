Week 11:
Week 11 was mainly focused on working on our assignments, although we did work on how to make box shadows and experimented with the code on that, it was a challenge to learn but interesting nonetheless. My assignment was starting to form up into its final form although still had a lot of improvements and feedback that I needed.
